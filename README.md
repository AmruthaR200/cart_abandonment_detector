# üõçÔ∏è Cart Abandonment Detector

## Project Overview

This project predicts cart abandonment for an e-commerce platform using machine learning. By analyzing user behavior metrics such as time spent on the site, pages viewed, and cart value, it predicts the likelihood that a user will abandon their cart. The project uses the **Random Forest Classifier** model to make these predictions and is hosted on a Flask web application with a simple user interface.
